# num2Roman
Convert numbers 0-4000 to roman numerals and roman numerals to numbers. 

namor will convert numbers to roman numerals.
roman will convert roman numerals to numbers.
romanamor will check if both processes are correct.

I could've went a better way about coding all of this, but oh well! (:
